# Rocket

Game about "doodle" in the space. Use A and D keys to control doodle.

Main goal – get into the hole.


You can choose different levels to play:

Zero – default gravity;

Heavy – increased constant downward gravity;

Up – upward gravity;

WhiteHole – gravity push you from target;

BlackHole – the pulling anomaly on the way to the target;

BlackAndWhite – the pulling anomaly + pushing from target;

 

By the default, the game uses the autopilot function for "doodle" to reach the target.

To turn that function off, you need to return Turn.None in Control.Task class.
